This Python script implements a simple Order Management System for a bakery using pandas and datetime modules.

The BakeryOrderManagement class represents the order management system. It contains methods to add orders, view orders, update orders, and save orders to an Excel file.

The __init__() method initializes the system with an empty DataFrame to store orders.

The add_order() method prompts the user to input customer name, item ordered, and quantity. It then adds a new order to the DataFrame with the current date and time.

The view_orders() method displays all orders in the system DataFrame. If there are no orders, it prints a message indicating that there are no orders available.

The update_order() method allows the user to update an existing order by specifying the order ID. It prompts the user to enter a new item and quantity for the order.

The save_to_excel() method saves all orders in the DataFrame to an Excel file named 'bakery_orders.xlsx'.

The main program loop allows the user to interact with the system by choosing different options: add order, view orders, update order, save to Excel, and exit.

Each option corresponds to a method of the BakeryOrderManagement class.

The discrimination provided above the code serves as a brief overview of the script's purpose and functionality.
